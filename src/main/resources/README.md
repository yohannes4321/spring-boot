Person Management ApplicationOverviewThis is a simple full-stack web application designed for managing a list of people. The application provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for person records, each consisting of a unique ID, a name, and a phone number.The project is built with:Backend: Java with Spring Boot (REST API)Database: PostgreSQLFrontend: Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptFeaturesCreate: Register a new person with a name and phone number.Read: Fetch and display a list of all registered people.Update: Modify the name and phone number for an existing person.Delete: Remove a person record from the database.Unique ID: Each person record is assigned a unique ID upon creation.PrerequisitesBefore running the application, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higherApache MavenPostgreSQL (version 15 or higher is recommended)Database ConfigurationThe application is configured to connect to a PostgreSQL database. Please ensure your database is running and the credentials match those in your src/main/resources/application.properties file.The connection details are as follows:spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yohannes
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=1245
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

This configuration tells Spring Boot to connect to a database named yohannes on your local machine using the specified username and password.How to Run the ApplicationFollow these steps to get the application up and running:Step 1: Start the PostgreSQL DatabaseMake sure your PostgreSQL service is running. The database name must be yohannes. If it doesn't exist, you can create it using a database client like pgAdmin or the psql command-line tool.Step 2: Package the Spring Boot ApplicationOpen a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project. Run the Maven clean package command to build the executable JAR file.mvn clean package

This command will compile your Java code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file inside the target/ directory.Step 3: Run the Spring Boot BackendAfter the packaging is complete, you can start the Spring Boot application from the command line.java -jar target/your-application-name.jar

(Replace your-application-name.jar with the actual name of your generated JAR file, e.g., demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar).Once the application starts successfully, you will see a log message indicating that Tomcat has started on port 8080.Step 4: Access the FrontendSince your index.html file is located in the src/main/resources/static directory, Spring Boot will serve it automatically.Open your web browser and navigate to:http://localhost:8080/index.html

You will see the registration form and the table that interacts with your backend API.API EndpointsThe backend provides the following REST API endpoints:EndpointHTTP MethodDescription/api/v1/personPOSTRegisters a new person./api/v1/personGETFetches a list of all people./api/v1/person/{id}PUTUpdates an existing person./api/v1/person/{id}DELETEDeletes a person by their ID.Visual GuideHere's an example of how to add an image with a header to this document.
