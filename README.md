Step 1: Start PostgreSQL Database

Ensure PostgreSQL is running. Create the database if it doesnâ€™t exist:
```
CREATE DATABASE yohannes;
```
Step 2: Package the Application

In the project root directory, run:
```
mvn clean package

```
This will generate a JAR file in the target/ folder.

Step 3: Run the Backend

java -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
When Tomcat starts successfully, it runs on port 8080.

Step 4: Access the Frontend

Open your browser:
```http://localhost:8080/index.html
```
